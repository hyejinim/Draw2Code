# Draw2Code

Draw2Code is a paper-based computational kit for young children aged 5 and older to create interactive AR animation. You can transform your physical form of a drawing to a virtual sprite that moves across the screen by drawing, coloring, and manipulating paper coding blocks. 

## Getting Started

- Print and cut out the coding blocks
  - [Coding blocks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ElkHP1LewVR8UKVX3hVORmDlwr0yeSNmIrRBa_yJFLg/edit?usp=sharing)
  
  - If you don't have a printer, you can still try with virtual coding blocks on the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ko0adOg=/)
- Link to the program: [Draw2Code](http://hyejinim.github.io/draw2code) (It only works in Safari on iPhone)
