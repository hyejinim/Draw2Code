# Draw2Code

Draw2Code is a paper-based computational kit for young children ages five and older to create interactive AR animations. You can transform your physical form of a drawing to a virtual sprite that moves across the screen by drawing, coloring, and manipulating paper coding blocks. 

## Getting Started

- Print and cut out the [coding blocks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ElkHP1LewVR8UKVX3hVORmDlwr0yeSNmIrRBa_yJFLg/edit?usp=sharing)
<!--   - Don't you have a printer? You can try it with virtual coding blocks on the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ko0adOg=/) -->
- Open the [Draw2Code application](http://hyejinim.github.io/draw2code) on your mobile device (It only works in Safari on iPhone)
