# Draw2Code

Draw2Code is a paper-based computational kit for young children aged 5 and older to create interactive AR animation. You can transform your physical form of a drawing to a virtual sprite that moves across the screen by drawing, coloring, and manipulating paper coding blocks. 

## Getting Started

- Print and cut out the coding blocks
  - [Download](https://github.com/hyejinim/draw2code/blob/master/assets/cards/draw2code_coding_cards.pdf)
  -- It only works on Safari, in iPhone
  - If you don't have a printer, you can still try with virtual coding blocks on the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ko0adOg=/)
